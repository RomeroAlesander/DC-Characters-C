Aqualad
Amphibious Ace
Aqualad is the lost son of the villain Black Manta and has only recently found out about his amazing powers. Black Manta has since tried to reclaim his son, but thankfully, Aquaman has taken the young hero under his wing to protect him and ensure Aqualad never falls prey to his father's evil ways.
