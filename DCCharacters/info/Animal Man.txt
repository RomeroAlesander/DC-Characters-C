Animal Man
One Man Zoo
Buddy Baker was a stuntman in the movies until the day he was given experimental powers by a group of aliens. They turned him into Animal Man - a hero who can replicate the powers and abilities of any animal on Earth. Buddy may be a bit of an animal now, but he's still just a family man at heart!
